<p>LAST month Barack Obama, following his approval ratings, headed south. He took a three-day bus tour through Virginia and North Carolina, both of which he had won in 2008, reversing a decades-long erosion of Democratic support in the South. He met soldiers, students and teachers. Virginia’s Democratic politicians, however, stayed away. Tim Kaine, a former governor now running for the Senate, pleaded a full schedule elsewhere. Others were less kind. Phillip Puckett, a Democratic state senator, declared, “I don’t plan to support President Obama for re-election.” Churlish, perhaps, but it worked: on Tuesday Mr Puckett won his own re-election battle.</p>
<p>Elections this week across three southern states produced oddly mixed results. The Republicans’ steady march through the state capitols and governor’s mansions of Dixie continued in Mississippi, where they appear to have captured the state’s House of Representatives from the Democrats for the first time since the aftermath of the civil war. Their candidate for governor, Phil Bryant, trounced Democrat Johnny DuPree (although voters spurned a proposal backed by both men, to confer “personhood” on the unborn). Yet in Kentucky Steve Beshear, the Democratic incumbent, romped home by an equally wide margin. Democrats riding on his coat-tails swept four of the five other statewide races. Virginia, meanwhile, saw only modest gains for Republicans, with control of the state Senate, previously in Democratic hands, hanging on a wafer-thin Republican victory headed for a recount.</p>
      
  <p>All this is of great interest to followers of national politics. Given Mr Obama’s fraying support in much of the Midwest, he will struggle to keep his job next year unless he can win at least one of the three southern states he carried in 2008: Florida, North Carolina and Virginia. Strategists from both parties are therefore poring over this week’s muddled results in an effort to decipher whether and under what circumstances Democrats can still prevail in the battlegrounds of the South.</p>
<p>There is little question that the Republicans remain the party to beat in most of the region. The drubbing that they delivered to Democrats in state elections in Louisiana last month is typical. Assuming Republicans have indeed taken Virginia’s Senate and Mississippi’s House, they will control every legislature in the South save in the fringe states of Arkansas, Kentucky and West Virginia.</p>
<p>The Democrats’ decline has been decades in the making. The presidential vote was the first to go, with the five deep southern states (Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina) plumping for Barry Goldwater in 1964 in spite of the fact that their congressional delegations were Democrats almost to a man. The wave accelerated in the 1980s, as Ronald Reagan captured the white, working-class voters who had kept conservative southern “yellow-dog” Democrats in office. In 2000 Al Gore, despite being a southerner himself, failed to win any southern states. There are now just two Democrats in statewide office in the deep South: Mary Landrieu, a senator from Louisiana, and Jim Hood, the attorney-general of Mississippi.</p>
<p>Even Mr Beshear’s victory is not as heartening for Democrats as it appears. Like Arkansas and West Virginia, Kentucky is firmly in the Republican column when it comes to presidential elections. Democrats may do well at the state level, but that rarely translates into victory in federal elections. Jack Conway, the state’s Democratic attorney-general, cruised to re-election this week by 10 points. But he was trounced in a Senate race last year by Rand Paul, viewed as extreme even by many Republicans.</p>
<p>Democrats in those three fringe states tend to succeed by distancing themselves from the national party. Mr Beshear directed Kentucky to join a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency over its coal-mining regulations. It was hard to find the word “Democrat” anywhere in his campaign bumf. Mike Beebe, the governor of Arkansas, has said he would have voted against Mr Obama’s health-care legislation had he been in Congress. Joe Manchin, then the popular Democratic governor of West Virginia, disavowed Mr Obama’s ideas about health-care reform and global warming—going so far as to run a commercial in which he fired a bullet through the cap-and-trade bill supported by Democrats in Congress—to secure a seat in the Senate last year. Earl Ray Tomblin, who won a special election to succeed Mr Manchin as governor last month, had a staunchly anti-abortion voting record as a state senator and was endorsed by the National Rifle Association. In spite of all of this, Mr Tomblin only just scraped by, thanks in large part to his opponent’s relentless efforts to tie him to Mr Obama.</p>
<p>Moreover, the success of Democrats in Arkansas, Kentucky and West Virginia rests on those states’ unusual demography, making it hard to emulate elsewhere in the South. All three are predominantly rural, and have fewer blacks and Hispanics than the national average. In other southern states big urban and minority populations hold sway in Democratic primaries, pulling candidates to the left of the general electorate and highlighting polarising issues such as race and immigration.</p>
<p>In fact, in recent federal elections in the South, Democrats have done best by appealing to minorities and relatively liberal migrants from outside the region—“eggheads and African-Americans” as one sneering pundit puts it. That is how Mr Obama carried Florida, North Carolina and Virginia, and how Democrats have retained Senate seats in all three states. Until recently, the Obama campaign even talked of turning Georgia, with its swiftly growing black and Hispanic populations (and a booming Atlanta economy that has attracted its share of eggheads) blue in 2012.</p>
<p>Mr Obama’s popularity has fallen in the Southern battlegrounds, but less quickly than it has in many Midwestern states. Blacks, who account for about a fifth of North Carolina’s population, are steadfast in their support, according to a recent poll. Residents who do not consider themselves Southerners, another fifth, favour Mr Obama by seven points over Mitt Romney, the Republican front-runner.</p>
<p>The election results from Virginia tell much the same tale. The Republicans picked up seats in rural, yellow-doggish areas. But the suburbs of Washington remained loyal to the Democrats, denying the Republicans a strong majority in the state Senate. That is enough to give Virginia Democrats a little hope.</p>
