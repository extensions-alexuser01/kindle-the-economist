<p>INFERTILITY is a great leveller. Around 3,500 whites, blacks and Asians—some rich, some clearly not so rich, mostly in couples or accompanied by the odd would-be grandmother—crowded into the Fertility Show at the Olympia convention hall in west London last weekend in search of help. There were stalls offering holistic therapy, nutritional guidance, ovarian-reserve testing and the like. But the crowds appeared thickest around the stalls that advertised donated eggs for <em class="Italic">in vitro</em> fertilisation. Most were foreign—from Spain, Cyprus, St Petersburg, Riga, Las Vegas, New England and Barbados. They were the tip of an iceberg.</p>
<p>The world’s first <em class="Italic">in vitro</em> baby was born in Oldham 33 years ago. But Britain is no longer a leader in the field. Today Britons are thought to make up one of the biggest contingents of the growing army of Europeans crossing borders for fertility treatment. Spain and the Czech Republic are their most frequent destinations, a sample survey led by two academics at De Montfort University found. The reason, says a spokeswoman for the Instituto Bernabeu in Alicante, is that in Spain there is no waiting list, and the donors remain anonymous. Neither is the case at home.</p>
      
  <p>One in six couples in Britain have trouble conceiving. The average age at which women first give birth has risen from 24 to 30 in four decades, and touches 35 if the woman has a degree. An increasing number of would-be mothers are obese, which makes things harder. With fewer people using condoms, sexually-transmitted diseases such as chlamydia have freer rein; and there are signs that sperm aren’t what they used to be. Around a fifth of women born in the early 1960s reached the age of 45 with no children, twice the share of the cohort born around 1950. It is hard to know how many made the choice deliberately.</p>
<p>As women get older, the eggs they warehouse do not work as well, hence the search for younger, donated ones. Britain’s supply is limited. Donors have been paid a pittance (£250 plus documented expenses). That is to be raised to a flat fee of £750, which may help recruitment. But another disincentive will not be changed: since April 2005 egg and sperm donors have been stripped of their anonymity. Though the number of registered donors is higher than it was then, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which regulates these things, says a greater proportion now may be “known” donors helping a friend or relative, or “egg-sharers” who get a big discount on their own fertility treatment by agreeing to share the eggs that result. At the Hewitt Centre for Reproductive Medicine at Liverpool Women’s Hospital, the waiting time for eggs has gone from six months to four years since that change, says Charles Kingsland, its clinical director.</p>
<h4>Too few, too expensive</h4>
<p>Beyond the specific shortage of eggs lies a general shortage of public funding. Only about a quarter of primary-care trusts provide the three cycles of fertility treatment recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Few people have private health insurance, and even fewer have policies that cover such care. HFEA estimated in 2008 that 85% of the cost of fertility treatment was being met from patients’ pockets. A cycle with donated eggs can easily cost £7,500 at a fertility clinic in England. The Instituto Bernabeu charges a slightly more modest €7,500 (£6,400) and promises money back if no pregnancy ensues.</p>
<p>Treatment abroad may also appeal to those who want more control over the eggs they get. British law does not allow infertile couples to pay more for the output of a PhD candidate—as America’s does, for example. Nor does it normally allow women to select embryos by sex. But cross-border forays are not an unalloyed good. In unregulated markets quality control is patchy. Donor anonymity means it is often impossible to get medical details that would be useful for the child. Especially in poor countries, donors may be exploited. And poor people in rich Britain may feel unfairly denied the right to a family.</p>
<p>Some now think the way forward lies in having girls freeze their eggs for later use. Technical advances are making that more plausible. But Clare Lewis-Jones, who runs Infertility Network UK, a charity that provides advice and support (and, incidentally, the Fertility Show), worries that women will postpone childbirth even longer thinking they have cash in the bank, only to find they don’t. The real answer is to not leave it too late, she says. How to achieve this? Start in the classroom. “Schools teach girls how not to have children,” she says. “They should also be teaching them to think about having children sooner.”</p>
