<p><em class="Bold">Italy’s borrowing costs</em> in the bond market surged to reach levels that are generally considered to be unsustainable, as market confidence evaporated in Italy’s ability to meet its debt obligations. The decision by LCH.Clearnet, a clearing house, to raise the amount of collateral it requires to insure against losses on Italian bond trades caused yet more investor anxiety. Italy’s yields could have been even higher, except for another reported round of bond-buying by the European Central Bank. <a href="21538161.html">See article</a></p>
<p>In a frenetic first week for Mario Draghi as president of the ECB, the central bank also took the surprise decision on November 3rd to cut its main <em class="Bold">interest rate</em> from 1.5% to 1.25%.</p>
      
  <h4>That giant sucking sound</h4>
<p>Mark Carney, the recently appointed chairman of the G20’s Financial Stability Board, warned of the dangers from a “severe retreat” in global market <em class="Bold">liquidity</em>, which<em class="Bold"> </em>would feed through into the real economy. Mr Carney pointed out the threat from the deleveraging efforts at European banks as they work towards higher core-capital requirements, which, he said, could have a negative impact on cross-border financing.</p>
<p><em class="Bold">Société Générale</em> booked a write-down of €333m ($450m) on its exposure to Greek debt, representing a 60% cut in the value of the bonds. This followed a similar move by BNP Paribas, its larger rival. The French bank also proposed scrapping its annual shareholder dividend for the first time since privatisation in 1987 and said it would reduce bonuses, as part of its efforts to strengthen its capital position.</p>
<p>A federal judge ordered <em class="Bold">Raj Rajaratnam</em> to pay $92.8m to settle civil charges related to his conviction for insider trading. The penalty is a record for a civil charge, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission, amounting to three times the profit that Mr Rajaratnam made from trading shares in which he had obtained illegal tip-offs.</p>
<p>The parent company of <em class="Bold">British Airways</em> reached an agreement to buy <em class="Bold">British Midland</em> <em class="Bold">(bmi)</em> from Germany’s Lufthansa. Bmi is the second-biggest carrier at Heathrow, controlling around 10% of the runway slots. A merged airline would give BA more than 50% of the slots at the airport, though it would probably need to sell off a number of these to satisfy regulators.</p>
<p><em class="Bold">Toyota</em> reported a 32% decline in operating profit between July and September, compared with the same quarter a year earlier. The carmaker cited the adverse effects on its business from a strong yen and the flooding in Thailand, where it builds some parts and vehicles, the latest Japanese company to do so.</p>
<h4>Freight expectations</h4>
<p><em class="Bold">Maersk’s</em> quarterly net profit fell by 78%. Although the Danish shipping line transported more containers, this was not enough to offset the impact from declining freight rates caused by an excess of capacity. Many shippers have expanded their operations in anticipation of a global boom. <a href="21538156.html">See article</a></p>
<p><em class="Bold">China’s</em> annual inflation rate fell sharply in October, to 5.5% from September’s 6.1%. The news was viewed as evidence that measures taken by the central bank to tame rising prices are working. Food prices, a politically sensitive topic in China, rose by 11.9% in October, compared with 13.4% in September. Other data showed a slowing of Chinese industrial production, leading some to suggest that the government will soon refocus on policies that promote growth rather than rein in inflation.</p>
<p><em class="Bold">Groupon’s</em> initial public offering was a success. In the biggest stockmarket debut by an American internet company since Google in 2004, Groupon’s stock closed 31% above the IPO price of $20 a share on the first day of trading, giving it a market value below that of Yahoo! Other internet companies are lining up to go public; it emerged this week that <em class="Bold">Yelp</em> is also considering a flotation. <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/11/babbage-november-9th-2011-0">See article</a></p>
<p>Adobe announced that it would not release future upgrades for its <em class="Bold">Flash player</em> on mobile devices. The late Steve Jobs was a strong critic of the reliability of Flash technology, banning it from Apple’s wireless gadgets. <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/11/interactive-technology">See article</a></p>
<p><em class="Bold">PPR</em>, a French luxury-goods group that owns some of the world’s best-known fashion houses, including Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, confirmed that it was buying <em class="Bold">Brioni</em>, an upmarket Italian menswear firm. Brioni started dressing film stars in the 1950s. Its suits have more recently been worn by Vladimir Putin and Daniel Craig playing James Bond. <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2011/11/ppr-buys-brioni">See article</a></p>
<h4>The rings of change</h4>
<p>The GSM Association, a group of worldwide mobile-phone operators, announced that <em class="Bold">Africa</em> is the fastest-growing mobile-phone market in the world, and the second-biggest after Asia. The number of African subscribers has grown by 20% each year for the past five years and is expected to reach 735m by the end of 2012.</p>
