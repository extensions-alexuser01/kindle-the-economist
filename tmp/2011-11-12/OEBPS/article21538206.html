<p>“THE toy industry has always reflected adult culture,” says Chris Byrne, an American toy-industry consultant. In the 1920s girls played with ironing boards because they expected later to iron their husbands’ shirts. The first 1950s Barbie dolls had two careers: fashion model and bride. So what do British toy shops say about the state of the nation today?</p>
<p>Good news first: the British are generous. Parents buy many more toys for their offspring than do their continental counterparts. Britain is Europe’s biggest toy market, followed by France and Germany, according to Frédérique Tutt, an analyst at NPD EuroToys. British parents buy an average of 41 toys per year, which is almost a toy per week. In Spain, by contrast, children receive few toys outside the Christmas season.</p>
      
  <p>Less encouragingly, Britons seem highly susceptible to media conglomerates’ marketing campaigns. Britain’s toy market is similar to America’s in favouring entertainment over education, says Gerrick Johnson, a toy analyst at BMO Capital Markets. About one-quarter of toy sales in Britain are licence-driven, which means they are based on characters from Disney films or television series such as the popular “Peppa Pig” and “Fireman Sam”. The proportion in Germany is just 14%.</p>
<p>German parents are bigger on engineering. Last year building sets accounted for 13.4% of German toy sales compared with only 8.6% in Britain. Germany is the biggest European market for Lego, the Danish maker of colourful bricks. Mediterranean countries are more traditional. Dolls account for fully 16.8% of toy sales in Spain, compared with 9.7% in Britain and just 7.9% in Germany. Italians buy a disproportionate number of toys from small, local makers.</p>
<p>UNICEF, a United Nations agency, slates British parents for encouraging “compulsive consumerism” in their children. Yet analysts think the British habit of piling children’s bedrooms with junk is changing, thanks to the economic slump. Movie-related toys have not sold as well as expected recently, says Mr Johnson. And Lego has been thriving in Britain, as it has everywhere else. The firm’s building sets are expensive, but they give parents lots of “play value”, which means children play with them for a long time without getting bored.</p>
