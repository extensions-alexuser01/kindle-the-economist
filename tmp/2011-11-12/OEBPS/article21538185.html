<p>Global business sentiment is worse now than on the eve of the financial crisis in 2008, according to <em class="Italic">The Economist/FT</em> survey of over 1,500 senior executives, conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Just 14% of those polled expect business conditions to improve over the next six months.

In September 2008 a similar survey put confidence at minus 37 points.
