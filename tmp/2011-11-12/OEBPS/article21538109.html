<p>LISTEN to the opposition Labour Party, and a shake-up of Britain’s electoral map now under way—with 50 parliamentary seats for the chop, and hundreds facing redrawn borders—is an act of partisan “gerrymandering”. Believe some disgruntled MPs, and the review threatens the very fabric of democracy, creating new seats that will cross county lines and other time-hallowed boundaries. Oddly, given that the review is a Conservative initiative, some of the loudest complaints come from Tory MPs.</p>
<p>The grumblers should get out more. Some years ago, Bagehot was sent after 51 Texan Democrats who had fled their home state to wreck a legislative session and with it a scheme to carve a batch of safe (if weirdly-shaped) Republican seats from the congressional map. Pursued by arrest warrants, the runaways holed up at an Oklahoma motel, offering visiting reporters interviews, cigars and whisky. The Democrats won that round, but after more wrangling and a legal fight that went to the Supreme Court, Republicans mostly got their map. That’s gerrymandering.</p>
      
  <p>This week, in contrast, Bagehot headed to Ludlow, a handsome market town in Shropshire, to watch a public hearing being held by the Boundary Commission for England. That independent body has been asked to draw up new constituencies with nearly identical numbers of electors each, a big change from the status quo (sister commissions exist for other bits of the British Isles). Nationwide, for various reasons, that change will probably favour the Tories more than other parties. But Ludlow’s hearing, in a Victorian former school hall, was hardly partisan at all.</p>
<p>Shropshire’s only Labour MP, David Wright, came to appeal against a proposal to split his current seat in two, probably eliminating his majority. Mr Wright argued for a constituency drawn tightly around the county’s largest town, the unlovely 1960s creation of Telford, surrounded by a second seat made up of villages and market towns. In psephologist-speak, he was arguing for a “doughnut”: a solidly Labour urban seat within a Tory outer ring. Conservative speakers came to lobby for what election-wonks call a “sandwich”: a pair of constituencies made up of urban, suburban and rural slices. They were taking a punt that one or both might return a Tory. Yet nobody could admit to pursuing party interests, for the Boundary Commission only considers appeals based on geography and the maintenance of “local ties”. The result was a festival of genteel special-pleading.</p>
<p>Mr Wright said that plans to split Telford in two would separate the foundry that makes the cast iron for Aga ovens (a brand of posh cookers costing as much as a small car) from the factory that assembles them. Speakers from Telford’s Labour-controlled council talked about its “urban heartland”, as if it were the Bronx. In pursuit of their own interests, Conservative speakers portrayed the nearby River Wye as an almost impassable barrier crossed by only a few, narrow bridges, and fretted that one proposed seat would involve a lot of driving for its MP.</p>
<p>From Much Wenlock, a pretty town full of pricey houses, came a plea not to be lumped in with grittier Telford. Nobody said it aloud, but this smelled of snobbery: Aga-owners not wanting to mix with Aga-makers. After each submission, the assistant commissioner—a grand London lawyer hired to oversee the public consultation—asked brisk questions and pored over bundles of maps. From outside came the reassuring tinkle of teacups, promising that a break neared. Later, party representatives denied they had been pursuing partisan goals. Well, maybe a bit, they admitted, but mostly their concern was preserving local communities. All believed absolutely in the commission’s independence.</p>
<p>This matters. Even at a time of deep hostility to politics, the British still have faith in avowedly impartial bits of the state, such as boundary commissions, public inquiries and judicial reviews. If the boundary review is causing unhappiness among politicians, that is largely because being an MP today is rather grim.</p>
<h4>The dangers of safe seats</h4>
<p>Labour unhappiness is easily explained. The review is expected to cost it about 20 MPs, partly because under-sized seats in Wales and Scotland will be culled. The Liberal Democrats are also due to take a pasting. Yet—for all that Conservative bigwigs expect to lose just 13 or so seats—Conservative MPs are among the grumpiest of all. A senior Tory describes a mood of “angst and stress”.</p>
<p>Angst among Tory parliamentarians has two causes. First, a sense that constituency associations have a whip hand over MPs: the expenses scandal did for deference, grassroots activists have firm views on such issues as Europe (and use the internet to track how MPs vote), and after the review many MPs will need to woo new associations. Local activists are unfussed about current Conservative MPs having to fight over the best new seats. This is about Shropshire, says one Tory stalwart, not “some MP’s career”.</p>
<p>Secondly, many Tory MPs distrust their leadership. David Cameron, the Conservative leader, has vowed that boundary casualties will be looked after. But the mood is so toxic that some right-wingers want him to put his pledge in writing, or to ditch the review altogether. Some MPs want ambassadorial appointments to be opened to seat-less Tories. With others hoping to be sent to the House of Lords, there is pressure to ditch a coalition pledge to Lib Dems to create a mostly elected upper house.</p>
<p>Politicians should not push their luck. In Ludlow market, shoppers declared that they did not care how large new constituencies were, if a smaller House of Commons saved money. Being an MP is an insecure business just now. On balance, that is a good thing: safe seats feed extremism. For all the Westminster grumbling, British political debate still leaves room for a moderate middle, and not just deafening partisans. Quaint, impartial boundary commissioners can take much of the credit.</p>
