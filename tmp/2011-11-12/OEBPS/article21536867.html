<p>EVERY COUNTRY SEES “Europe” as a projection of its own hopes and fears. For Germany it is redemption; for France a means to amplify French power; for Italians it is not Rome; for Belgians it is not Brussels; for the Baltic states it is a long way from Moscow; for Romania and Bulgaria it is order; for Spain it is the solution; and for much of central Europe it is home.</p>
<p>The rest of the world has a stake in what happens in Europe, too. The overwhelming feeling is frustration that European leaders seem so incapable. Andrew Balls, of PIMCO, the world’s largest bond investor, says that the difference between emerging-market crises and G10 crises has always been that you expect G10 governments to remain in control. After a series of half-rescues of the euro, he wonders whether this rule still applies.</p>
      
  <p>It is a sure bet that at crucial moments America will be on hand to browbeat Europeans into taking action. The Federal Reserve will stand by to back the European Central Bank. Neither wants to see the world economy dragged into recession by European blunders. But America has enough troubles of its own.</p>
<p>The idea that China might become a dragon ex machina, spending hundreds of billions of dollars on the bonds of troubled European governments, is fantasy. China will offer encouragement. It may invest in the euro zone’s new special-purpose vehicles to buy the debt of troubled euro-zone governments—with the right political concessions, it may even be generous. But the amounts of hard Chinese cash will be limited, if only because the euro zone’s creditor nations were unwilling to put more of their own money into the pot.</p>
<h4>The ins and outs of being in</h4>
<p>Within the EU, the crisis is a test of the European dreams of countries that are not part of the euro zone. Many of them are relieved to have escaped the turmoil. But they are now in a spot. If one day they surrender their own currencies, as in theory they pledged when they joined the EU, the revamped governance of the euro will affect them deeply.</p>
<p>Take Poland, by far the biggest economy among the former communist countries and still outside the euro zone. It has had a good crisis, being the only EU country to avoid a recession, at least so far. That is mostly because of domestic demand, but also partly thanks to its ability to devalue the zloty.</p>
<p>And yet mainstream opinion in Warsaw is in no doubt that the nation’s destiny is tied to the euro, and particularly to Germany. That is partly an economic calculation. Germany is a vital export market for Poland. Its components and parts help make German industry competitive. Ryszard Petru of demosEUROPA, a think-tank, argues that being part of the euro would help ensure that foreign direct investment (FDI) keeps coming. It has been very important in modernising the Polish economy, but remains relatively low.</p>
<p>The Polish establishment also thinks that the euro makes political sense. Although the country started as fiercely Atlanticist after communist rule came to an end, it is now somewhat disenchanted with the United States. When Barack Obama cancelled the Bush administration’s missile-defence shield (which would have protected Poland) in 2009, he chose a fraught date: September 17th, the anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939. Poles felt slighted, even though the system’s replacement turned out to be bigger and better. They also think they were not properly rewarded for their support of America in Iraq.</p>
<p>As the idea has gained ground that the euro zone might form an EU inner circle, so Europe itself has come to seem more important to Poland. “It is not just tactical,” says Aleksander Smolar of the Stefan Batory Foundation, a think-tank. “For 1,000 years we have been trying to get into the real Europe, Charlemagne’s Europe. Many times we have failed.”</p>
<p>Politicians are quick to say that Poland “has no problems with tighter discipline and budget control”. They point out that the Polish constitution already says government debt should not exceed 60% of GDP—one of the criteria of the EU’s much-abused stability and growth pact. Polish officials still have fresh memories of their country’s EU accession, when they were bossed around and told to shape up. After that, a dose of euro-zone discipline might not seem too irksome.</p>

</div>
<p>What does worry Poles, though, is any hint that their country might lose influence. The normally equable Donald Tusk, Poland’s prime minister, flew into a rage in February when his country and the other nine euro “outs” looked as though they might be excluded from the “competitiveness pact”, a German scheme to help integrate the 17 economies in the Eurogroup. Mr Tusk won a reprieve, with a promise that the outs could join in a special “euro plus” group. But this may not add up to much: the real decisions may still be taken by the 17 euro members. In the end, if Poland wants to be confident of making its voice heard, it will probably have to take the plunge and apply to join them.</p>
<p>They see things differently in Britain, and to a lesser extent Denmark, both of which have formal exemptions from joining the euro—though Denmark’s currency is pegged to it. The dominant emotion among Eurosceptic Britons is not sympathy for their main trading partners but fury that Britain is being dragged down by what they see as continental Europe’s failure.</p>
<h4>Blighty and bluster</h4>
<p>Under the Conservative Party, the senior partner in the ruling coalition with the pro-European Liberal Democrats, Britain is fast drifting off into the Atlantic Ocean. Many Conservatives would like to use a new treaty on the euro, agreed on among all 27 EU members, as a chance to put some British business onto the table. One group of Tory MPs has suggested repatriating powers over criminal law, social policy, financial regulation, farming and fisheries. These are not fringe voices: fully 81 Tory MPs defied their party to vote against the government in a recent bill calling for a referendum. In a continent full of visions of Europe, none is more jaundiced than Britain’s. But even allowing for that, the Conservatives’ scheming looks bafflingly complacent.</p>
<div class="pullquote">Tory MPs think they hold all the cards, as they reckon that the euro zone needs their backing to reform EU treaties. In fact, Britain’s hand is weak</div>
<p>The crisis could profoundly affect British interests. The euro zone represents over 40% of Britain’s trade. London is the EU’s biggest financial centre. And senior officials in Brussels think the Eurogroup could well become a place where important business is done, to the disadvantage of outsiders. “I see a real danger of Europe splitting,” says one.  Resented all over the continent as a bad European citizen, Britain should not expect any sympathy if the agenda turns against it. When you ask euro-zone politicians about British interests, they say: “If Britain is worried, there’s an easy solution. It should come into the euro.”</p>
<p>Tory MPs think they hold all the cards, because they calculate that the euro zone needs British backing to reform the EU’s treaties. In fact Britain’s hand is weak. Rather than give in to British demands to repatriate powers, the 17 euro-zone countries could just sidestep London and sign a treaty outside the EU.</p>
<p>The Tory desire to strip down relations with Europe, as if Britain might become a giant Norway or Switzerland outside the club, makes no sense either. Britain is too big to be left alone by the rest of the EU. At risk is the single market. Not only is it the most important EU institution for Britain, but without Britain’s liberal voice it may well veer towards protectionism.</p>
