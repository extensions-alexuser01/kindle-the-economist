      <p class="abstract">A battle over American-led free trade brews in Asia</p>
      
      <hr />
      
      <p>THE American president is bringing a new—or at least rewarmed—cause to the Asia-Pacific region: free trade. Barack Obama recently signed a ground-breaking free-trade agreement (FTA) with South Korea, after years of Washington foot-dragging. He signed FTAs with Colombia and Panama on the same day. On November 12th-13th the president hosts an Asia-Pacific trade jamboree in Honolulu which, he seems to hope, will give momentum to the idea of a remarkably ambitious free-trade zone at just the time when global trade talks are going nowhere.</p>
<p>Mr Obama’s plans hang on negotiations for a little-known but rather liberal trade grouping, called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). These will take place on the sidelines of the annual summit of APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation), a gathering long famed for its waffling. Currently, TPP members number only four small economies: Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore. But over the past year America, Australia, Malaysia, Peru and Vietnam have made progress in talks to join the club.</p>
<p>Were America a member, its trade with its eight fellow TPP members would amount to little more than 5% of all its foreign trade. But some quietly hope that the TPP will serve as a “docking station” for an APEC-wide free-trade area. That would further move the global centre of economic gravity from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific.</p>
      
  <p>An announcement was expected after <em class="Italic">The Economist</em> went to press that will heavily influence such an outcome. In Japan the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, was expected to declare that his government would join the TPP talks, despite strong reservations even from within his own party. Japan’s share of America’s trade, at 5.6%, exceeds that of all the current TPP partners put together. A combination of American and Japanese heft could, say TPP advocates, entice other countries, such as Canada, to join the group. Even China, where some are deeply suspicious about the project, might eventually feel compelled to join.</p>
<p>Yet such impetus also hangs on South Korea. There, President Lee Myung-bak’s Grand National Party is desperately attempting to force ratification of the FTA with America through the National Assembly. It faces vigorous opposition from left-of-centre opponents—the same people who were in power when the original deal was agreed on in 2007. The public mood has shifted to the left before parliamentary elections next April.</p>
<p>Mr Lee’s struggle to win approval for the FTA in what is one of the most trade-dependent nations on earth foreshadows political problems that are almost bound to arise elsewhere during attempts to enlarge the TPP. In America many greet the prospect of Japan’s inclusion with caution. Congressional leaders from both parties question whether membership would really succeed in breaking down Japan’s “deeply embedded barriers” to cars, farm products, medicines and other American exports.</p>
<p>There is opposition from the United Auto Workers union, whose backing will be crucial for Mr Obama in the presidential election next year. His support for free trade has never been more than tepid. Adding to the potential complications, the TPP would need the Obama administration to ask Congress to pass the bill under “fast-track” trade-negotiating authority, something very unlikely in an election year.</p>
<p>Smaller TPP members will welcome Japan more readily, partly because it would give them access to a second huge market in addition to America’s. And Tokyo might act as a counterweight to Washington in sensitive areas such as pharmaceuticals. However, all the minnows worry that the “gold standard” trade talks might be tarnished by enlargement. Currently, almost everything except labour mobility is up for liberalisation, making the TPP one of the most comprehensive free-trade treaties yet conceived. But if Japan takes part, it may seek to take its protected rice market off the table. That might embolden American efforts to shelter its extravagantly subsidised sugar industry.</p>
<p>Yet the biggest battle may be in Japan itself. Analysts say that though Mr Noda believes in the TPP as a means to bring about a more competitive economy, he has yet to convince the public of its merits. And so the field is open to vocal opponents, who include protected farmers, doctors and small businessmen fearing an onslaught of competition. The main argument used in favour of TPP in Japan has been defined in negative terms: that without it, Japanese firms will be hard-pressed to compete with South Korean ones benefiting from their country’s myriad free-trade deals of late. That is hardly an inspiring cause.</p>
<p>To win over American sceptics, Mr Noda will need to convince his counterparts that he has enough domestic support to negotiate in good faith. If he can achieve that, Japan might start a long-overdue push to reform and revitalise its economy. And then the TPP might become more than just another Asia-Pacific acronym that only wonks have heard of.</p>
