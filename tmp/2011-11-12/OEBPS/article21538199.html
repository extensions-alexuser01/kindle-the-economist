<p>MUAMMAR QADDAFI was adept at negotiating with Tuareg nomads in the Sahara and created alliances with many of their clans. Hundreds of Tuareg fighters stood by him as his regime fought a losing battle for survival. Now they are going back to the desert regions of Chad, Mali and Niger, possibly bringing a host of problems with them.</p>
<p>Some Tuareg acquired high-tech weapons during Libya’s civil war, and may have taken them home. At least 13 died in a shoot-out with government forces in Niger on November 9th. Gold dished out by fleeing Qaddafi officials could pay for insurgencies. Fighters might also link up with al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, a regional terror group. This comes at a time of growing radicalism in Mali and Niger, with illiterate and disillusioned citizens finding solace in mosques.</p>
      
  <p>Yet talk of Tuareg uprisings is often overstated. For all their swagger and Star Wars-style dress, the Tuareg are not numerous. Mali has 75,000 in a population of 15m. Some rebel groups may contain no more than a few dozen fighters. The main threat from the Libyan revolution to its southern neighbours is the economic impact. Idriss Déby, Chad’s president, owed his strongman role in part to Qaddafi’s largesse. He is not trusted by Libya’s new rulers, who are unlikely to continue the colonel’s open-purse policy. Chadian oil revenues are also in decline.</p>
<p>Mali is more stable, but President Amadou Touré is stepping down next year and elections may be combustible. Another concern is the new Libyan government’s lack of interest in Qaddafi’s investments in Malian agriculture, which this year produced bumper harvests. In Niger the government has had to work hard to distance itself from dozens of Qaddafi loyalists, including at least one son, who have taken refuge in the country. Furthermore Tuareg returning from Libya are mostly from Niger. An estimated 200,000 Nigerién migrant workers have suddenly come home as well. President Mahamadou Issoufou, who came to power this year after replacing a caretaker military regime, is already dogged by coup attempts.</p>
