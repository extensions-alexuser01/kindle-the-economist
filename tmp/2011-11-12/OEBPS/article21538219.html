<p>SHORTLY after he was elected president in 2007, Nicolas Sarkozy marched uninvited into a meeting of European Union finance ministers in Brussels to declare that France was postponing by two years its commitment to balance its budget. Even as the financial crisis set in a year later, he banned the term “austerity”, a word that was said to scare the faint-hearted French. But now, with France’s AAA credit rating still on the line, Mr Sarkozy is reinventing himself as a champion of fiscal prudence.</p>
<p>On November 7th the government unveiled its second austerity plan in three months. This one promises savings worth an extra €7 billion ($9.5 billion) in 2012, on top of the €11 billion announced at an emergency budget meeting in August. The new measures do not alter the timing of France’s plan for the public finances: the deficit should still fall to 4.5% of GDP next year, and 3% in 2013. But the faltering economy means France needs an extra effort in order to meet these targets. In an interview last month, Mr Sarkozy conceded that GDP growth in 2012 would reach only 1%, down from a previous forecast of 1.75%.</p>
      
  <p>By current European standards the new French plan, which Mr Sarkozy left to his prime minister, François Fillon, to announce, is modest. Three-quarters of the measures taking effect next year are tax increases, not spending cuts. The rate of VAT on restaurant bills, for instance, will rise from 5.5% to 7%. Big companies face an extra five percentages points in corporate tax. The better-off will be particularly squeezed: income-tax and wealth-tax thresholds will be frozen, and investment income taxed more heavily. On the spending side, immediate cuts are limited, though more meaningful reductions will take effect in years to come. Raising the retirement age to 62 years, for example, will be brought forward by a year, to 2017.</p>
<p>Action was certainly needed. France is the weakest of the six AAA euro-zone countries, and its banks are badly exposed to the likes of Greece and Italy. Last month Moody’s put its credit rating under surveillance. As a share of GDP, public spending is higher in France even than in Sweden. Borrowing costs are rising. Mr Fillon’s stern tone this week—“‘bankruptcy’ is no longer an abstract word”, he said—and the government’s rapid response to the worsening outlook should help calm markets. France’s plan proves a “clear willingness” to defend its credit rating, according to Guillaume Menuet at Citigroup.</p>
<p>How long it will hold things together is a different matter. Natixis, a French investment bank, reckons that growth in 2012 will fall to 0.5%, half the government’s forecast. It says extra savings worth up to €5 billion may be needed to meet next year’s deficit target. Citigroup thinks growth will be just 0.1%, and identifies a potential need for another €9 billion of savings.</p>
<p>The trouble is that France holds a presidential election next spring. This means that, should yet more emergency measures be needed early next year, Mr Sarkozy will be even less likely to make spending cuts, which the French dislike, instead of tax increases, which they tolerate. As it is, Mr Fillon’s tone is bolder than the measures he has announced. With European leaders around him tottering, Mr Sarkozy is not about to embark on unpopular structural reform of the welfare state. Indeed, he says he is proud of having “sheltered” the French from the sort of painful cuts other leaders have had to make.</p>
<p>It is not clear that voters will thank him for his trouble, though they may appreciate his energetic efforts to solve the euro-zone crisis. Last week, Mr Sarkozy managed to get Barack Obama to appear next to him for a gushing television interview after the G20 meeting in Cannes, in which the American president hailed the “impressive leadership” of his French counterpart. Although the G20 was wrecked by Greek drama, Mr Sarkozy was nonetheless portrayed in France as a tireless and authoritative leader. He may still be trailing his Socialist rival for president, François Hollande, in the polls. But the gap is narrowing. One poll carried out after the G20 gave him an eight-point jump—taking him to his highest level since February 2010.</p>
