<p>THE rewards for digging carbon out of the ground differ wildly. A tonne of coal fetches around $120. A diamond for the same price would be so small you’d probably never find it in the first place. Anglo American, a big mining firm, struck a deal on November 4th at the loftier end of the market. It agreed to pay the Oppenheimer family (see <a href="21538143.html" target="_self">article</a>) $5.1 billion for their 40% stake in De Beers, the world’s leading diamond miner, to add to the 45% that Anglo already owns. It looks a fair price; the diamond industry’s prospects are sparkly.</p>
<p>For a start, supply is tight. All the world’s big deposits are thought to have been discovered already. Old mines are growing tired. Total annual output will probably fall. At the same time, demand is roaring in China, India and the Gulf, where the new rich love ostentatious adornment. By 2015 these countries could be buying as many diamonds as America, which currently accounts for two-fifths of global demand. To add to the cheer, demand is growing rapidly in America, too. Diamond prices have risen by over 50% this year.</p>
      
  <p>De Beers, however, is no longer the diamond geyser it once was. In the 1990s it mined half the world’s stones and controlled the sales of 80%. But then shoppers started to worry about “blood diamonds” that might finance Africa’s nasty wars. Tracing a gem’s provenance is hard. So, to avoid the risk of bad publicity, De Beers decided to market only those it dug up itself.</p>
<p>Its market share tumbled. Now it produces 35% of the world’s diamonds by volume and faces far stiffer competition. Alrosa, Russia’s state-backed diamond miner, now rivals it. And Anglo will have to compete for new mines with other giants, such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, which between them dig 17% of the world’s diamonds. Ambitious smaller miners, such as South Africa’s Petra Diamonds, are also looking to stick their picks in.</p>
<p>This may prove a problem. Anglo has not distinguished itself in the past decade. A plodding general miner, it may find it hard to haggle with the canny and highly knowledgeable dealers who are the prime customers for rough diamonds.</p>
<p>At the same time governments, which typically control mineral rights, are driving ever-harder bargains. Botswana pockets around 80% of the profits from its joint venture with De Beers, which yields a whopping two-thirds of De Beers’s sparklers. Botswana also has a pre-emption right over the Oppenheimers’ shares, so it may yet increase its stake in De Beers from 15% to 25%. De Beers operates in some tricky countries: Angola is unstable and South Africa has politicians who would love to nationalise its mines. Anglo’s recent strategy has been to mine in easier places; the De Beers deal may drag it deeper into quagmires.</p>
<p>More competition means De Beers can no longer control prices the way it used to: by buying diamonds when markets are weak and selling when they strengthen. The Oppenheimers may have decided that De Beers is past its prime, and opted to turn their “glass with attitude” into cash.</p>
