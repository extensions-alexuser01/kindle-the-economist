<p>MANCHESTER’S town hall is a Victorian neo-Gothic temple to local government, packed with murals commemorating episodes from the city’s history. As the capital of Britain’s long-gone cotton trade, the city is particularly well-endowed with 19th-century civic grandeur; but all over the country, the juxtaposition of the splendour of the old buildings with the impotence of modern councils speaks eloquently of the decline of local government in Britain.</p>
<p>Now the Conservative-Liberal Democrat government wants to shift power to locally elected mayors. The aim is a worthy one, and the only thing wrong with the plans is that they do not go nearly far enough.</p>
      
  <p>For more than a century governments have sucked power away from Britain’s cities. These days most mayors have little more than a gold chain to show for their offices, and local government is kept on a short financial leash by Whitehall, which provides most of the money that it spends, thus undermining its power and its responsibility.</p>
<p>The previous Labour government went some way towards reversing that trend by encouraging a few cities, including London, to vote for mayors. Now the current government wants to do more. Next year voters in as many as 11 others will be asked whether they want to join the club (see <a href="21538144.html" target="_self">article</a>). If city-dwellers plump for elected mayors, they will have large fiefs. A mayor of Leeds, for example, would hold sway over more people than the mayor of Washington, DC, does.</p>
<p>The government argues that mayors will strengthen local democracy because they are more accountable to voters than are appointed council leaders. The new mayors will be able to knock heads together, and their ability to attract media attention will help to foster civic pride.</p>
<p>But there is opposition. First, some worry that populism will lead to the election of hard-right mayors. Second, councils fear a further diminution of their powers. And, third, some argue that urban strongmen will not sit easily with other government efforts to devolve power both to smaller neighbourhoods and to larger regions: the government wants to bring in elected police commissioners, for example, most of whom will oversee territories bigger than cities.</p>
<p>But concern about the outcome of an election is not a good reason to avoid one. If elected mayors enhance local democracy, it doesn’t much matter if local councils are undermined. And if instead of creating elected police commissioners, the government gave the mayors oversight over the police, the problem of overlapping fiefs would not arise.</p>
<h4>No representation without taxation</h4>
<p>This points to the real flaw in the plans: they are not bold enough. The government seems to have no intention of giving mayors powers over serious matters such as policing. Rather, it envisages them largely as urban boosters who will entice business and provide a counterweight to local busybodies who want nothing built in their backyards. Thus, mayors are to have powers to cut business rates but not raise them.</p>
<p>London’s increasingly powerful mayoral office, currently occupied by Boris Johnson, provides a better model. Mayors should be given considerable control not just over policing but also over planning and transport. On education, mayors can support the free schools the government has empowered people to set up: in America, mayors have turned out to be some of the strongest advocates for charter schools. And the law should be changed to allow mayors to appoint cabinet members from beyond the ranks of elected council officials. In the long term financial power must shift too. Local government needs to have the power to raise more cash, as well as to spend it. As soon as people realise mayors are spending their money, they will take a keen interest in what they do.</p>
<p>The government’s willingness to experiment with localism is welcome, but its timidity may doom the experiment. If city-dwellers believe that mayors will be costly figureheads, they are likely to vote against them. A chance to reshape Britain for the better will be lost, perhaps for many years.</p>
