      <p class="abstract">Above anything else, Europe’s troubled economies need growth</p>
      
      <hr />
      
      <p>OVER THE PAST decade Europe’s troubled economies have lost competitiveness against Germany, as the charts on the previous page show. Within a fixed currency they cannot devalue. Instead they need a combination of lower real wages, lower input prices and higher productivity. Higher inflation in Germany would make that easier. Structural reforms are hard, otherwise governments would have undertaken them long ago. But if countries continue to avoid hard choices, the adjustment will eventually be forced on them through recession and unemployment.</p>
<p>At the same time these economies must work off their debts. For the public sector, that can be through a combination of tax increases, spending cuts or growth. But it is hard, not least because Western societies have started ageing, which means that fewer people are in work paying tax and more in retirement claiming benefits. The IMF reckons that for the rich world’s governments to take public debt back to 60% of GDP by 2030 they would need to improve their budget balances by a huge 8% of GDP by 2020. If governments fail to get their borrowing under control, then the adjustment will, again, be forced on the economy—this time by the bond markets.</p>

<p>Experience suggests that some policies are better than others. If you want to increase competitiveness, productivity growth is less disruptive than wage cuts, and wage cuts are better than unemployment. If you want the government to shift its fiscal balance, you should cut spending by roughly four times as much as you raise taxes. Growth is better than either tax rises or spending cuts—but, experience also suggests, growth after credit busts is scanty. The best recipe for growth is to raise productivity through structural reforms—but nobody said that was easy.</p>
