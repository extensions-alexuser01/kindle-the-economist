      <p class="abstract">A row over lax border guards conceals a bigger problem with immigration</p>
      
      <hr />
      
      <p>THE Home Office is a politicians’ graveyard. Three of the current home secretary’s five immediate predecessors left under a cloud; a fourth thought it so awful that he broke up the department. For 18 months Theresa May has looked unassailable in her kitten heels, two-stepping deftly past the landmines of policing reform and immigration caps. But thanks to a brouhaha over Britain’s border agency, UKBA, she was pondering the implications of a near-death experience as <em class="Italic">The Economist</em> went to press.</p>
<p>The row began on November 3rd when it emerged that passport-control officials had been relaxing entry procedures at Heathrow airport and elsewhere to manage queues. They did not always open biometric passport chips or check details against a list of undesirables. The man in charge, Brodie Clark, and two others were suspended. Whether any dangerous folk were waved through is unknown, but it makes for a rousing political dogfight, studded with calls for Mrs May to resign.</p>
<p>The home secretary says she authorised a trial of light-touch inspection for Europeans, including children travelling with their parents, to allow agents to focus on more suspicious people. She did not authorise treating other arrivals that way, she insists. UKBA’s chief executive confirmed her account, saying Mr Clark had admitted to exceeding ministerial instructions.</p>
      
  <p>But immigration gaffes in Britain are never quietly forgotten. By the time Mrs May had blamed Mr Clark in the House of Commons and the Home Affairs Committee, Mr Clark had had enough. He resigned, saying that she had made his position untenable, and intends to sue for “constructive dismissal”.</p>
<p>Formed in 2008, when the Home Office was dismembered, UKBA has always been a mess. A big project to digitise information recedes expensively into the future. The Home Affairs Committee recently charged the agency with all kinds of slackness, including losing touch with over 100,000 immigration cases.</p>

<p>However bad UKBA and the row over it may be, a more serious fight awaits. The Tories came to power promising to reduce annual net migration from around 200,000 to the “tens of thousands”. A steep rise in immigration spooked Britons a decade ago, and they have not calmed down much since (see chart). An online petition urging the government not to let Britain’s population hit 70m by 2027, as it is currently expected to, attracted over 100,000 signatures in seven days, according to its sponsor, a lobbying think-tank called Migration Watch. The government has tightened work and study visas for non-Europeans. It is whittling away at family reunification rights, and plans to make it harder to settle permanently in Britain. But the numbers are not yet budging.</p>
<p>Provisional figures show long-term immigration in the year to December 2010 at 575,000, about the same as before. Outflow was 336,000, less than the 427,000 it reached in 2008. Net migration was thus 239,000, 20% higher than the year before.</p>
<p>It is likely that net migration will fall a bit as government measures are fully implemented. But the target of tens of thousands looks remote. Students, mostly from outside Europe, account for two-fifths of all immigrants. Most are the genuine article, now that many bogus colleges have been closed. Migration from EU countries cannot be cut and may even grow.</p>
<p>One reason is that, as it becomes harder to bring in workers from other parts of the world, EU migrants may fill those jobs, keeping numbers up. This may be happening already. Net migration from eastern European countries, which reversed when Britain’s economy collapsed, is rising sharply again, points out Carlos Vargas-Silva of Oxford’s Migration Observatory. Single men are bringing their families: Polish women accounted for the biggest share of foreign-born mothers in 2010. Established communities will attract others.</p>
<p>But that is a fight for the end of this parliament, when accounts are settled. For now, Mrs May is likely to stay, barring eyecatching exposés or economies with the truth. Until recently, she was a safe pair of hands. She is also a woman, and David Cameron is short of them. He lost one colleague a month ago; were Mrs May to follow the former defence secretary, Liam Fox, so quickly, it might raise questions about the prime minister’s ability to run a cabinet, still less a country. And it is possible that Mrs May will turn out to have been in the right.</p>
