<p>Barack Obama seldom gives a speech without calling for millionaires, billionaires, private-jet owners and oil companies to pay more taxes. But the middle class had been given a break until this week, when the Department of Agriculture decided to charge a 15 cent levy per Christmas tree. The proceeds were to be used "to strengthen the Christmas tree industryâ€™s position in the marketplace", a euphemism, presumably, for class warfare against the owners of plastic trees, especially evil imported ones. Republicans gleefully bewailed the tax on Christmas, with much invocation of Grinches and Scrooges. The fearless public servants in the White House resisted a full 24 hours before rescinding the fee.</p>
