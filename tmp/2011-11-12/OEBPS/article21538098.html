      <h3>Private equity</h3>
      <h2>Fee high so dumb</h2>
      
      <p class="abstract">Some buy-out firms’ fees have gone up</p>
      
      <hr />
      
      <p>THE high fees that private-equity firms charged in the boom, typically 2% of the assets they oversee (the “management” fee) and 20% of the upside (the “performance” fee), are harder to pocket now. Investors have been bearing down on these fees for the past two years. Even big firms are reportedly caving in, particularly for those writing large cheques.</p>
<p>But one type of fee has bucked the trend. A new study by Dechert, a law firm, and Preqin, a research outfit, finds that “deal” fees, which portfolio companies have to pay to private-equity firms for various services, actually rose in 2009-10, in spite of all the hullabaloo around lower charges. Transaction fees, which buy-out firms charge firms when they buy them (and yes, you did read that right), went up by at least 25% on average for 2009-10 deals that were $500m or larger, compared with deals done between 2005 and 2008. Deals between $500m and $1 billion, for example, had an average transaction fee of 1.24% of the deal amount in 2009-10, compared with 0.99% in 2005-08. “Monitoring” fees, which portfolio companies pay their private-equity owners each year for advisory services, also went up.</p>
<p>Deal fees essentially enable buy-out firms to get paid twice to do their job—first by investors and then by their portfolio companies. They even charge fees when they exit investments. When Nielsen, a market-research firm, went public earlier this year it had to pay around $101m to its seven private-equity owners to end their “advisory” agreements. Absurdly, some private-equity firms even charge portfolio companies fees for helping them refinance their debt—when they’re the ones to pile on leverage in the first place.</p>
      
  <p>Why would deal fees be on the rise? Given that investors won’t let them raise their management fees, and in many cases they’re still a long way from earning performance fees, it could just be that deal fees are one of the remaining sources of cash for buy-out firms. If so, their future may be shaky. Already some firms like Warburg Pincus don’t charge them because it hurts the morale of their firms’ management, who don’t like being milked. “It’s been part of our pitch to investors that we don’t do deal fees,” says Joseph Landy, one of Warburg Pincus’s two bosses.</p>
<p>Investors themselves may actually be behind the rise in fees, however. Many complain about private-equity firms keeping deal fees for themselves. “Transaction fees are a thorn in my side; monitoring fees are a knife in my head,” one executive at a pension fund moaned at a conference last year. Investors say private-equity firms should turn over all the fees to them or use the money to offset the management fee. For funds raised this year around 83% of transaction fees are being distributed to investors, up from 70% for funds raised in 2009. If private-equity firms are turning over more of their deal fees to investors, they may have been hiking them so they can keep some for themselves.</p>
<p>It is strange, however, that more investors aren’t just calling for the elimination of deal fees, rather than their redistribution. One cynical private-equity executive says it’s because of the way some investment staff at pension funds are paid. In some instances, recouped deal fees appear to boost returns, increasing their own compensation. It sounds like just the sort of trick they might have picked up from private-equity firms.</p>
