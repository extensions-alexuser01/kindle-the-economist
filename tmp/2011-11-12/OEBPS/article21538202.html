      <h3>Business in Cuba</h3>
      <h2>A risky venture</h2>
      
      <p class="abstract">Arrests of foreign businessmen reflect the cautious pace of reform</p>
      
      <hr />
      
      <p>STANDING beside Belarusian tractors and Chinese machine parts at Havana’s annual trade fair last month, Rodrigo Malmierca, Cuba’s foreign trade minister, said the presence of 3,000 executives from over 60 countries proved the appeal of joint commercial ventures with the Cuban government. Many in the audience saw the speech as an attempt at reassurance. Since July Cuba has arrested several foreign managers, and closed three such ventures.</p>
<p>Most recently, on October 11th, Amado Fakhre, a British citizen and the head of Coral Capital, an investment fund, was woken at dawn and taken for questioning by state security agents. He has been held without charge ever since. His company owns Havana’s poshest hotel in partnership with the government, and hoped to win a $400m contract to build homes around a golf course. Its Havana office has been closed and declared a crime scene.</p>
<p>Two Canadian executives, Sarkis Yacoubian and Cy Tokmakjian, have met a similar fate. Their questioning has gone on for months, again without charge. Their companies imported cars (including the president’s fleet of BMWs) and machine parts destined for nickel mining.</p>
      
  <p>Cuba’s official media have not published details of the cases. But rumours of the allegations—which range from overpaying local staff to offering kickbacks for contracts—highlight the difficulties for foreign investors posed by President Raúl Castro’s incremental approach to reform.</p>
<p>After the fall of the Soviet Union, Mr Castro’s brother and predecessor, Fidel, decided that Cuba had to court foreign investment to survive. Hundreds of companies, mostly from Europe and Canada, soon began investing in oil, mining and hotel construction. However, the government never set up tender contests to pick its corporate partners, encouraging corruption. It also required firms to hire workers through a state employment agency that paid meagre salaries, and to restrict any perks—even extra-tasty lunches in staff canteens.</p>
<p>As public finances deteriorated, the government cut distributions of subsidised food. Meanwhile, prices for items like soap and petrol have soared. State salaries of $20 a month can no longer cover basic expenses. Cubans fill the gap by trading on the black market, receiving foreign remittances or stealing from state firms.</p>
<p>Raúl Castro is trying to be bolder than his brother. To shrink the public payroll, he has legalised self-employment in over 180 professions. Last month he authorised Cubans to buy and sell homes and cars. Perhaps because some of these steps are controversial, he is also cracking down on corruption, which the cash-strapped state can no longer afford to fund. Gladys Bejerano, the comptroller-general, has had dozens of employees in the sugar, mining, telecom and tobacco industries jailed for graft.</p>
<p>Yet for now, Mr Castro still considers letting foreign firms pay market wages a step too far. That has forced companies to break the law—and run afoul of his newfound efforts to enforce it. “My people help run a business which brings in millions of dollars to Cuba,” says one European businessman, who pays bonuses to his entire local staff under the table. “I need to pay them a monthly salary which is rather more than the price of a taxi ride home.”</p>
