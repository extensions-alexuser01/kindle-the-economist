      <h3>Philadelphia’s mayor</h3>
      <h2>Michael, more</h2>
      
      <p class="abstract">Michael Nutter easily wins a second term in City Hall</p>
      
      <hr />
      
      <p>AT HIS inauguration in January 2008, Philadelphians waited for up to four hours outside City Hall to shake newly-elected Michael Nutter’s hand. He promised a “new day and a new way.” And in many ways he fulfilled that promise, despite being hampered by a weak economy and an often unco-operative city council. With Democrats still outnumbering Republicans in the city by six to one, it was no surprise that he was easily re-elected on November 8th. The last time a Republican was the mayor of Philadelphia was in 1952. Mr Nutter won 75% of the vote, soundly beating two weak challengers. Turnout was very low, at about 18%. But even so, it seems clear that Philadelphians want Mr Nutter to finish what he set out to do.</p>
<p>He took office with ambitious goals. He promised to lower the murder rate by 30-50%. Philadelphia, a city whose name means brotherly love, is still one of America’s most violent. In 2007 there were 392 killings. Although the rate has fallen by an impressive 20%, already this year there have been 282 murders, a shockingly high number for a city of 1.5m people. Violent crime is at its lowest since 1992, all the more remarkable given that police overtime has been cut as have police academy classes. The city prison population is down by 11% since 2009. Perhaps most telling, according to one poll, Philadelphians worry less about crime than in 2009.</p>
<p>The big worry for residents is the economy. Mr Nutter was only in office for a few months when the bust began to affect the city. As the <em class="Italic">Philadelphia Daily News</em> put it, he went from “managing a city to managing a crisis.” Unemployment, at 10.9%, is much higher than the national figure, and one in four live in poverty. According to Pew, the percentage of adults neither working nor looking for work is higher than in any big city bar Detroit and Cleveland.</p>
      
  <p>Mr Nutter managed to avoid mass lay-offs. But he cut spending and he raised sales tax and property taxes, something one in five cities had to do this year. Planned tax breaks were delayed. He cut his own salary. And he deferred payments into the state pension fund—worryingly, as it is woefully underfunded.</p>
<p>Daniel Fee, a Democratic political strategist, reckons that Mr Nutter did a good job in his first term, but nothing really bold. That may be true, but what he has done, he did well. Earlier this year, for instance, his response to violent “flash mobs” was swift and effective. He announced curfews for teens and accompanying fines for their parents. And, so far, he is smoothly handling the Occupy Philadelphia protesters, who are literally camped on City Hall’s doorstep. He has embraced ethics reform, no small thing in Philadelphia. In his second term, he plans to take on the city’s abysmal education attainment level. He feels strongly about gun control. Dodgy types can get their hands on guns far too easily, including by renting them, which he calls “insane”. As Mr Nutter said during his re-election victory speech, “we are not done yet”.</p>
