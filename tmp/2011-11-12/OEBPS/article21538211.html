<p>Silvio Berlusconi said he would resign as <em class="Bold">Italy’s</em> prime minister, once the country’s parliament passes a series of austerity measures demanded by the European Union. Mr Berlusconi called for fresh elections, but it looked likely that a new government would be formed, perhaps led by Mario Monti, a former European commissioner. The political uncertainty saw yields on Italian bonds spiral yet higher, leading to concern that the country may struggle to refinance its huge debt pile. <a href="21538161.html">See article</a></p>
<p>Lucas Papademos, a former vice-president of the European Central Bank, was named <em class="Bold">Greek</em> prime minister. His appointment at the head of a government of national unity came after four days of wrangling over who should succeed George Papandreou. <a href="21538217.html">See article</a></p>
      
  <p>Gas began to flow through the controversial Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects <em class="Bold">Russia</em> to <em class="Bold">Germany</em> under the Baltic Sea. Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s president, travelled to Germany to attend the formal opening.</p>
<p><em class="Bold">France’s</em> prime minister, François Fillon, announced a new set of austerity measures to ensure that the country remains on track to meet its deficit-reduction targets. In unusually tough language, Mr Fillon said France had been overspending for 30 years, and that “bankruptcy” was “no longer an abstract word.” <a href="21538219.html">See article</a></p>
<p>The two men vying to be <em class="Bold">Spain’s</em> next prime minister took part in their only televised debate before the general election on November 20th. Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba of the ruling Socialists went on the attack against Mariano Rajoy, leader of the opposition People’s Party, but failed to land a blow. Mr Rajoy looks set for a clear election victory.</p>
<h4>One by one</h4>
<p>The <em class="Bold">Colombian</em> army killed Alfonso Cano, the leader of the FARC guerrillas. Mr Cano had led the group since its founder died of a heart attack in 2008. <a href="21538205.html">See article</a></p>
<p>Otto Pérez Molina, a former general, won <em class="Bold">Guatemala’s</em> presidential election. Mr Pérez has promised a crackdown on gang violence. In <em class="Bold">Nicaragua</em> Daniel Ortega, helped by a strong economy, was re-elected as president. A spate of violence broke out after Mr Ortega’s victory, in which at least four people were killed. <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/americasview/2011/11/presidential-elections-nicaragua-and-guatemala">See article</a></p>
<p>The Institute for Justice and Democracy in <em class="Bold">Haiti</em>, an American pressure group, announced that it would seek hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation from the UN for cholera victims in Haiti. The disease was probably brought to the country by Nepalese peacekeepers. The group says it will file a lawsuit if the UN does not respond.</p>
<h4>In case you weren’t sure</h4>
<p>The International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, published its latest report on <em class="Bold">Iran’s</em> nuclear programme. It stopped short of saying conclusively that Iran was developing nuclear weapons but raised serious concerns about the military dimensions of the country’s nuclear activities. <a href="21538146.html">See article</a></p>
<p>The UN said that more than 3,500 people have died since March in <em class="Bold">Syria’s</em> uprising. Despite a proposed peace deal drafted by the Arab League, at least 60 people have been killed in the past week. The government announced that it had released political prisoners as a first step to implementing the deal, but opposition figures said that thousands more remain in jail. <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2011/11/syrias-uprising">See article</a></p>

<p>In <em class="Bold">Liberia’s</em> presidential run-off Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the incumbent, was poised to be declared the winner. The election was marred by violence and turnout low after William Tubman, her opponent, urged his supporters to boycott the poll over allegations of electoral fraud.</p>
<p>In <em class="Bold">South Africa</em> the ruling African National Congress sacked Julius Malema as head of its youth wing and banned him from the party for five years. Mr Malema is a controversial figure who rouses his supporters with incendiary speeches and is an outspoken critic of Jacob Zuma, the president.</p>
<p>Boko Haram, an Islamist sect, killed scores of people in a series of attacks mostly in the town of Damaturu in <em class="Bold">Nigeria’s</em> north-east. Boko Haram gunmen also shot a police inspector. The group told a newspaper that it was behind the attacks and that it plans to hit further government targets.</p>
<h4>Halting the conservative tide?</h4>
<p>There were several elections in America on state and local issues. Voters in <em class="Bold">Ohio</em> overturned a law that restricted the right of public-sector workers to bargain collectively. The law was passed in the state legislature in March, as newly elected Republican governors in the Midwest and elsewhere tried to curtail the power of public unions. <a href="21538188.html">See article</a></p>
<p>In <em class="Bold">Mississippi</em> an attempt to define a fetus as a person was decisively rejected at the ballot box. The “personhood amendment” would have in effect outlawed abortion in the state.  Mississippians also elected Phil Bryant as their new governor, to replace the term-limited Haley Barbour. <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/11/mississippis-election">See article</a></p>
<p>Jefferson County in <em class="Bold">Alabama</em> moved to file for bankruptcy protection with around $4 billion in debts. It is the biggest municipal bankruptcy to date in America, substantially larger than Orange County’s insolvency in 1994.</p>
<p><em class="Bold">Rick Perry</em> made another gaffe at the Republican presidential debates, when, after hesitating for 53 seconds, he could not remember the name of the third government agency he insisted he would shut down upon entering office. The other candidates shouted out their suggestions.</p>
<h4>Finally facing justice</h4>

<p>A court in <em class="Bold">India</em> convicted 31 people for their part in the massacre of 33 Muslims in 2002. The victims were trapped by a mob in a burning house in Gujarat state during some of the worst rioting since Indian independence.</p>
<p><em class="Bold">Japan</em> released the captain and crew of a <em class="Bold">Chinese</em> fishing boat, three days after they were arrested for entering Japanese coastal waters. A similar case last year in disputed waters sparked a diplomatic confrontation, but China called this incident a “regular fishery case” and accepted Tokyo’s handling of it.</p>
<p>In <em class="Bold">New Zealand</em> a ceremony was held to deconsecrate Christchurch cathedral. The building was badly damaged by an earthquake in February that killed 182 people. The ceremony paves the way for the building to be partially demolished, and for a new cathedral to be built.</p>
