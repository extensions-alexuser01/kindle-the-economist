<p>TIPOS INFAMES IS a fine bookshop in central Madrid, run by three young friends and stocked with the sort of books you were always meaning to read, until work and children got in the way. Well aware that the intellect needs gentle encouragement, the owners lure you in with strong coffee and generous glasses of Spanish wine. Running a bookshop is difficult, says “Curro” Llorca; these days he doesn’t get so much reading done either. But business is passable.</p>
<p>Curro and his friends needed three years to set up shop. They had to obtain a full house of separate permits, one to sell books, a second to sell coffee and a third to sell wine. The town hall said not to worry and advised Curro to open his doors while he was still waiting for the paperwork. But the budding entrepreneurs wondered what they would do if the police turned up.</p>
      
  <p>Tormented by unemployment, Spain needs new firms like Tipos Infames. Yet in the World Bank’s ranking of how easy it is to start a business the country comes only 133rd, after Kenya.</p>
<p>Next to quelling the crisis, the single most important task facing Europe’s economies is to grow, because only then will they eventually be able to pay off their debts. In order to do that, they need to improve their competitiveness. And the best route to improved competitiveness is to streamline the public sector and overhaul the markets for labour and services.</p>
<p>Yet Europe has failed for many years to accomplish just such structural reforms. Looking at Curro, the economic logic for change is unanswerable. But the politics is grim. Across Europe, business is held back by bureaucracy. Powerful interest groups are protected at the expense of everyone else.</p>
<p>The crisis only strengthens the case for reform (see <a href="21536870.html">article</a>). But it also means that reform must take place against the background of austerity, as societies struggle to determine who will shoulder the burden of debt. The darkening clouds of civil disobedience and anarchy confronting Greece’s new government show where this struggle can lead. Europe’s future depends not just on governments putting forward the right policies but on the capacity of democracies to bring about peaceful change.</p>
<h4>How to gain in Spain</h4>
<p>How might reform work? Again, consider Spain. Reform there should stand a good chance. The country has done well out of EU membership. After it joined in 1986, incomes caught up with the rest of the union. Its large exporters have remained an island of efficiency, as competitive as any in Europe. Spain recently signalled its commitment to the euro zone by writing a cap on future deficits into the constitution.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Spanish may be about to vote for change. An election later this month is likely to bring in a new conservative government under Mariano Rajoy of the People’s Party (PP). If the opinion polls are to be believed, he stands to win a sweeping victory and to be able to govern with an absolute majority. Given that the PP also controls many of Spain’s regions, Mr Rajoy will have an unprecedented mandate to remake Spain. “People know the PP is going to be severe,” says José Ignacio Torreblanca of the European Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
<p>But what a task he faces. A prime target will be Spain’s notoriously dysfunctional labour market. This provides a group of ageing, virtually unsackable “insiders” with gold-plated contracts, whereas the rest have to make do with highly insecure temporary contracts. Among other things, insiders benefit from wage-escalation clauses, so that in 2009 real pay rose by 3.2% even though the economy shrank by 3.7%.  And Spain gives young people a terrible deal: in a downturn they are the first to be sacked. Not only are roughly half of under-30s out of work, but those who do have jobs are mainly on temporary contracts that leave them without a career structure and give firms no incentive to train them.</p>
<p>Mr Rajoy is elusive about his plans. The outgoing government has undertaken some labour-market reform, but most people expect the PP to go much further and doubt that the weakened Spanish unions will be able to put up much of a fight. But that is the easy bit. To transform the Spanish economy, Mr Rajoy also needs to take on two far more elusive foes.</p>
<p>First is the country’s dense jungle of regulation and bureaucracy. This dates back to Franco, who from the 1950s sought to give Spaniards more freedom by trying to establish the rule of law even as he denied them democracy. The profusion of administrative law created a dense and unaccountable bureaucracy. Ignácio Sanchez-Cuenca, director of the Juan March Institute in Madrid, encountered so many obstacles to hiring academics from outside the EU for the institute that it took up a quarter of his time. So he hired a firm of lawyers to do the job and now spends 5-10% of his budget that way.</p>

</div>
<p>What makes Spain’s bureaucracy especially poisonous is Mr Rajoy’s second foe: the country’s fiercely independent regions. Each tends to interpret regulations in its own way, so over time the Spanish market has fragmented. Juan José Güemes, a PP politician and a professor at the IE Business School in Madrid, explains how the star-rating system for hotels differs slightly across Spain, which limits competition among national and international chains and reduces economies of scale. Last year the Catalan government decreed that hotels must serve <em class="Italic">pa amb tomàquet</em>, bread with tomato, a local speciality, if they are to count as “luxury”. Miguel Cardoso, an economist at BBVA, a Spanish bank, estimates that, thanks to a lack of competition, half of the inflation in Spain over and above the average for the euro zone in the past 15-20 years came from firms increasing their margins.</p>
<p>Mr Güemes’s colleague at IE, Fernando Fernández, adds that each of the regions sponsors its own development policy and its own businesses, often financed by local savings banks. This is inefficient, but the regions are popular because they spend taxes collected by the central government. Moreover, regional autonomy is an antidote to the centralising, anti-union bias of Franco’s Spain. Even if the centre can control the regions’ spending—a big if—“we have a free market at the national level and are protectionist at the regional level,” says Mr Fernández.</p>
<p>Each reforming government in Europe faces different obstacles, but Spain is typical of them all in the sense that radical structural reform entails rewriting the social contract. Just now the generous wages of many of those in Spain’s protected jobs are supporting entire households of unemployed spouses and grown-up children. Scrapping thousands of bureaucratic rules will not just make the economy more efficient but also recast the relations between government and citizen. However unambiguous the economics of reform, the politics is almost always hard.</p>
<p>Too hard for some. Rome alone is said to have half as many lawyers as the whole of France. The legal system there moves so slowly, Italians joke, that they put you in jail when you are accused and release you when they find you guilty. Yet faced with the liberalisation of their profession in a recent budget, Italy’s lawyers somehow managed to hang on to their perks—was it because so many politicians are lawyers?</p>

<p>Instead of imposing reforms, the fag-end of a government under Silvio Berlusconi has relied excessively on tax rises. After he was shamed by euro-zone leaders during recent summits Mr Berlusconi at last came up with a more ambitious programme—but even then he was obliged to accept the supervision of the IMF. The mix of hopelessness and humiliation has left his government close to collapse.</p>
<div class="pullquote">Spain needs new companies like Tipos Infames. Yet the country comes only 133rd in the World Bank’s ranking of how easy it is to start a business</div>
<p>Others have shown more courage. Ireland’s government has cut wages and slashed benefits and services. Unit labour costs have fallen by 8% and the economy grew by 1.6% in the second quarter. The cuts have been even harsher in Estonia, where the economy shrank by 15% in 2009. Growth has soared since then and unemployment tumbled. Still, both economies face a hard slog. Because they are counting on foreign demand as a source of growth, they are vulnerable to a global recession.</p>
<p>The nightmare is Greece. Government there has never been about the rational design and administration of policy, but about dishing out patronage. When George Papaconstantinou, the country’s finance minister at the time, was asked why tax receipts collapsed in 2009, the year his government came to office, he explained that “the first thing the government does in an election year is pull the tax collectors off the streets.”</p>
<p>Even so, the government of George Papandreou (in which Mr Papaconstantinou served) undertook reform with a savagery that would once have been unthinkable. He had a gun to his head, because the troika of the EU, the IMF and the ECB release aid each quarter only if the Greek government meets its targets.</p>
<p>Yet, beset by protests, a shrinking economy, the dishonour of being bossed around by foreigners and the prospect of a decade of further austerity, Mr Papandreou could not carry the country with him. His reluctantly resigned, following a botched proposal to hold a referendum on the euro zone’s plans for Greece. The installation of a new government of national unity smacks of Argentina, where a succession of short-lived administrations fought to avoid default—before eventually succumbing.</p>
<p>Mr Papandreou’s ejection contains a warning. At root, the solvency of a country is determined by the government’s capacity to raise revenues and cut spending. Politicians run up against the popular will long before they run out of things to tax.</p>
<p>The crisis has also brought down governments in Ireland, Portugal and Slovakia. Spain, and others, are likely to follow. Where will voters turn when they have had their fill of austerity and reform? The lesson of the 1930s and of emerging-market crises down the years is that people can take only so much austerity. If the burden gets too heavy, the political system collapses.</p>
<p>This fear lies behind the warnings of Milton Friedman and Martin Feldstein, two American economists, who said that the euro is inherently unstable. Until recently euro zone leaders scoffed at such talk. But in the past couple of weeks they have suddenly begun to contemplate Greece’s departure from the single currency. And contemplation is one step short of action. Their change of heart is not just because of mayhem in Athens, but also because of the difficult politics of the euro at home.</p>
