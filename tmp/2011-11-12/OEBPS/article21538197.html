<p>WHEN the allegations of sexual harassment first surfaced, one of Herman Cain’s lines of defence, apart from asserting that he had never harassed any woman in his life, was that he could not respond to anonymous allegations. That particular line of reasoning is no longer available to the Republican presidential candidate after two of the women came forward this week to give their stories.</p>
<p>First, on November 7th, came Sharon Bialek (pictured), who popped up at a press conference in New York, with a celebrity lawyer in tow, to claim that Mr Cain groped her in 1997 when he was running the National Restaurant Association and she was seeking a job. She said that, in a car after dinner and drinks, Mr Cain had stuck his hand beneath her skirt, reached for her genitals and pulled her head towards his crotch. Though he desisted when she told him that was not what she wanted, she accuses him of responding: “You want a job, right?”.</p>
      
  <p>Next to surface, a day later, was Karen Kraushaar, the hitherto unnamed employee of the restaurant association who had received a severance payment after complaining of sexual harassment. Now a spokesperson at the Treasury, she said she hoped that all the women who claim to have been harassed by Mr Cain might now decide to give their evidence together. At least two other women have yet to identify themselves.</p>
<p>In defending himself Mr Cain has insisted steadfastly on one central point, namely that all the allegations against him “simply did not happen”. But his explanation for the flood of allegations has been less consistent. At different times he and his campaign have blamed the liberal media, the Democratic machine and Rick Perry, one of his Republican rivals. In Arizona this week he said the problem was that he was a businessman, and “the machine to keep a businessman out of the White House is going to be relentless”. Asked if he would submit to a lie-detector test, he said he would, but only if he had a “good reason”.</p>
<p>One reason might offer itself soon. Mr Cain’s polling numbers are starting to slide. This week’s <em class="Italic">Economist</em>/YouGov poll finds that 21% of Republican primary voters intend to vote for him, a fall from 26% last week, which means he has lost his position at the head of the field to Mitt Romney, who now scores 24%. Mr Romney is also sure to be helped by the latest instalment in the implosion of Rick Perry, the governor of Texas and another former Republican front-runner. During a debate on November 9th, he forgot the details of his own plan for dismembering the federal government, stammered excruciatingly and ended with the distinctly unpresidential word “oops”.</p>
