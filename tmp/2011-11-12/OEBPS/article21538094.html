  <p>SIR – Your coverage of global population growth missed one key point (“<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21533409" target="_self">Now we are seven billion</a>”, October 22nd) . While it is true that the world’s average family size has fallen dramatically in the past 40 years, a relatively small group of countries, including places like Afghanistan and Niger, continue to have between four and seven children on average and rapid population growth. These countries also happen to be poor, low on the Human Development Index, often treat women badly, and in some cases, like Somalia, are failed states spawning international terrorists.</p>
<p>You asserted “family planning appears to do little directly to control the size of families.” This is incorrect. Couples in virtually all societies have frequent sex, and therefore access to family planning is necessary to separate sex from childbearing. Most experts say that family planning has been critical in reducing family size in, for example, Iran and Bangladesh. You even mentioned in your briefing “A tale of three islands” that Bangladesh’s total fertility rate has “halved in 20 years”.</p>
<p>If foreign aid agencies invested heavily in voluntary family planning and girls’ education, then desperately poor countries with rapid population growth could escape from poverty and avoid becoming failed states.</p>

<p>SIR – You counselled us not to worry about the world’s expanding population. But we must. Population growth occurs mainly in poorer countries, you said, where low personal consumption has small environmental impact. However, living standards in such countries are rising fast, and migrants to rich nations quickly adopt the lifestyles of their destinations. Globally, the average individual impact is set to keep rising, even in the unlikely case that rich countries substantially reduce theirs.</p>
<p>You also said that fertility is declining, suggesting that the world population will peak in a few decades. But that decline cannot be assured; you have written before that fertility in rich countries may be rising again. We don’t know whether a peak will occur soon without policy influence, or how high it will be.</p>
<p>Our impact on the global ecosystem is already unsustainable. To address the environmental damage that is already occurring, much of it effectively irreversible, we need to achieve a population peak as low and as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Sir Adrian Stott<br>Hertford, Hertfordshire  </p>
<p>SIR – Is China’s one-child policy really “a demographic disaster” as you say? When the policy was put in place some 30 years ago the official justification was that population growth interfered with economic development. They have proven that this is true, a fact not yet recognised in the West. Now they are talking of relaxing the policy because it is widely accepted by the urban Chinese whose lifestyles have vastly improved because of it.</p>

<p>SIR – Your article about Liberia’s president and Nobel-peace-prize winner, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, (“<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21532332" target="_self">A Swedish October surprise</a>”, October 15th) will have come as a surprise to many of your readers, particularly in Norway.</p>
<p>Since 1901 the Nobel peace prize has been awarded by the Norwegian Nobel committee, not by any Swedish one. The other Nobel prizes are awarded by Swedish committees. I was surprised you got this wrong after so many years of getting it right.</p>

<p>SIR – The cover of your <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21532448" target="_self">special report on business in India</a> aptly depicted the sad state of affairs in my country (October 22nd). The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, and the hapless middle class is squeezed in between.</p>
<p>You painted a rosy picture of Indian corporatism without portraying the plight of those Indians who are still living on less than a dollar per day. Developing economies like India have failed to provide growth that is inclusive for all. Just like neighbouring China, there is a growing disparity between the haves and have-nots, all thanks to our booming economy. There is also growing labour-union tension.</p>
<p>Until India Inc and the government show some concern towards employees and citizens, we cannot really enjoy the fruits borne out of the growing economy.</p>
<p>Karanth Ramakrishna<br>Bangalore  </p>
<p>SIR – Although it is undoubtedly true that Indian firms and professionals are doing quite well internationally, when it comes to managing a diverse workforce and working in different countries and cultures, things are not as positive as you described. Handling a diverse workforce within India is something totally different from working in the countries and cultures of Europe. From my own experience I know that many Dutch businesses complain that Indians do not understand the local culture.</p>
<p>Most Indian businesses still refuse to train their staff properly. Their implicit assumption, that if you can make money in India you can make money anywhere, is nonsense. Much of their success is simply based on cost advantages. But as salaries are rising fast in India, this won’t last.</p>
<p>Bert van Hijfte<br>C. Consultancy<br>Amsterdam  </p>
<p>SIR – I wonder what has changed over the past 31 months since you published an upbeat article about Indian entrepreneurs (“<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/13216067" target="_self">The more the merrier</a>”, March 14th 2009). As a serial entrepreneur in the process of setting up my third venture, I think you made some valid observations. Yes, it is difficult to raise money as a start-up, especially if the business is capital hungry, and state regulations can sometimes be stifling, time consuming and expensive to comply with. But Indian entrepreneurs remain uncaged.</p>
<p>It was incorrect to base your conclusions about the Indian entrepreneurial scene on the recruitment results for business schools. Many prominent executives at Infosys, Bharti, Adani Group and Deccan have never even studied at business school</p>
<p>Sachin Kulkarni<br>Managing partner<br>Innovatous<br>Mumbai</p>
<p>* SIR – You teased out some of the paradoxes of the Indian economy that still surprise many, including the fact that although Indians are known for their enterprising acumen, there is a near-absence of entrepreneurs working in e-commerce, except for a few notable successes such as Flipkart, which you mentioned. </p>
<p>Although many bits of Indian industry have leapfrogged over their rivals from other countries to achieve great success in areas like information technology, internet-driven businesses remain stuck. The reasons for this lie in the structure of technical teaching in India’s higher-education system. The new series of reforms that India is looking to make in higher education would do well to unleash the drive for research, innovation and entrepreneurship among its abundant young population. </p>

<p>SIR – Your cover dated October 29th, which depicted Europe’s leaders trying to leave a sinking ship, reminded me of Edward Lear’s <em class="Italic">The Jumblies</em>:</p>
<ul>They went to sea in a Sieve, they did, <br>In a Sieve they went to sea: <br>In spite of all their friends could say, <br>On a winter’s morn, on a stormy day, <br>In a Sieve they went to sea!</ul>
<p>Sadly, as Lear relates:</p>
<ul>The water it soon came in, it did, <br>The water it soon came in.</ul>
<p>However, with the help of a “pinky paper”, a “moony song” and “no end of Stilton cheese”, the Jumblies return as heroes—after 20 years. Let us hope that Angela Merkel, Nicolas Sarkozy and the Greek government rescue Europe more speedily.</p>

<h4>Early scribblings</h4>
<p>SIR – Your article on malaria mentioned Chinese texts from 2700BC (“<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21533361" target="_self">Not swatted yet</a>”, October 22nd). There are no Chinese texts from that time. The earliest surviving Chinese writings, inscribed bronzes and oracle bones from the Shang dynasty, date from about 1600BC. (Consequently the frequently mentioned “5,000 years of Chinese history” is actually 3,700 years.)</p>
<p>You were presumably referring to the Huang Di nei jing su wen which has a few passages describing symptoms of a disease now known to be malaria. This text is traditionally attributed to the mythical Yellow Emperor, who in later historicisation has been arbitrarily assigned to years around 2700BC. While the text is not precisely datable, the best contemporary scholarship says that the materials that formed it began to be assembled in the last couple of centuries BC. It probably came together around 100AD, although the earliest surviving edition dates to the eighth century AD.</p>

<h4>The great British weather</h4>

</div>
<p>SIR – Having read your article on economics and religion (“<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21534762" target="_self">Holy relevance</a>”, October 29th), I’d like to propose the weather as an historical indicator of a nation’s work ethic and prosperity.</p>
<p>If Britain enjoyed warm temperatures and 300 days of sun a year, would its people so easily accept enclosing themselves in a workshop, factory or office for eight or so hours every weekday, even if it led to increased prosperity? Isn’t life too short not to be enjoyed?</p>
<p>If the Greeks woke up four days out of five to find the sun was nowhere to be seen, with rain and wind more than probable, would they still opt for leisurely lunches on patios, noontime naps and short working days? One may as well stay inside and work, there’s little else to do.</p>
<p>How would these two countries’ economic destinies be different today had they gone through history with the other’s weather patterns?</p>

<p>SIR – Was it necessary to refer to IBM’s new boss as “the blonde, straight-talking Ms Rometty” (“<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21534841" target="_self">Steady as she goes</a>”, October 29th)? Would you have mentioned hair colour if the new boss was a man? Or was it simply an attempt to dispel that old myth that blondes aren’t very clever? Or that they have more fun? I would like to think it was the latter rather than a traditional, old-school perspective that seeks to define a woman by her appearance, even when it is irrelevant to the situation and borders on sexist.</p>

<h4>Fooling yourself</h4>
<p>SIR – The real problem with mind-reading technology (“<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21534780" target="_self">The terrible truth</a>”, October 29th) is that we could no longer deceive ourselves.</p>
<p>Richard Spalding<br>Preston  </p>
<p>SIR – Lying is not only at the heart of civilisation as you said but also at the heart of the human species. Telling fibs without being detected and detecting those told by others is key to our intelligence. And honestly, the truth is the most malleable of concepts.</p>
