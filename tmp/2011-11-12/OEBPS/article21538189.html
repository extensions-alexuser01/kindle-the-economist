      <h3>The deficit supercommittee</h3>
      <h2>Hints of a deal or a false dawn?</h2>
      
      <p class="abstract">Republicans hint at flexibility on taxes to reach a budget deal</p>
      
      <hr />
      
      <p>AMERICA is at an impasse over its finances because, in a nutshell, Democrats will not agree to less generous social entitlements unless Republicans agree to tax increases; and Republicans will not agree to tax increases. This dynamic has produced one showdown already and now threatens another as a “supercommittee” of six Democratic and six Republican legislators seeks $1.2 trillion-1.5 trillion in deficit cuts over the coming decade by November 23rd.</p>
<p>It is thus significant that Republicans may be wavering in their opposition to higher taxes. On November 2nd 60 Democratic and 40 Republican members of the House of Representatives sent a letter urging the committee to reduce the deficit by $4 trillion, which would, unlike the $1.5 trillion target, be enough to put the federal debt on a downward path as a share of gross domestic product. All spending and revenues “must be on the table,” it said.</p>
<p>Past Republican offers of new revenue have rung hollow because, on closer examination, they included little in the way of actual tax increases, emphasising instead one-off sales of public land, oil and gas leases, and radio spectrum; higher postal rates; and increased premiums for Medicare, the federal health plan for the elderly. One Republican offer disingenuously included $200 billion of revenue from the higher growth their plan would supposedly bring about. Non-partisan scorekeepers don’t normally count such benefits, as they are too hard to quantify.</p>
      
  <p>Then, on November 7th, Pat Toomey, a Republican senator from Pennsylvania and member of the supercommittee, submitted a proposal that, according to news reports, would cut spending by $770 billion and raise $550 billion to $600 billion in new revenue. While most of that revenue would still come from fees, sales and other creative ploys, it also reportedly comes from closing loopholes, such as on charitable deductions and mortgages on second homes.</p>
<p>The offer still contained what for Democrats would be a deal-killer: it would not only make permanent the lower marginal income tax rates enacted by President George Bush in 2001, it would lower the top rate even further, to 28%, from its current 35% (Mr Obama has repeatedly pressed to let it return to its pre-2001 level of 39.6%). That strikes Democrats as an intolerable gift to the wealthy: most of them want the top rate to rise, even if lower rates are frozen.</p>
<p>Still, the principle of closing loopholes in return for lower marginal rates is one that Democrats have embraced in the past, provided that the result is a net increase in receipts. Thus, Mr Toomey’s offer represents the potential, though not yet the substance, of a deal. But mistrust still permeates the process. Democrats believe Republicans are making empty offers in hopes of blaming Democrats when talks collapse. Republicans doubt Democrats’ sincerity on entitlement changes and reckon real reform will have to wait until, as they hope, they win both the White House and the Senate in a year’s time.</p>
<p>At best, then, the committee will reach its mandated $1.5 trillion. It may well fall short; if the number agreed is lower than $1.2 trillion (or if there is no deal at all), automatic cuts to defence and discretionary domestic spending, are supposed to take effect in 2013 to make up the shortfall. But with a year and an election intervening, those cuts may never occur. “Congress is not bound by this,” John McCain, a Republican senator and former presidential candidate with a bad habit of speaking the truth, recently noted. “It’s something we passed; we can reverse it.” Congress has a record of doing just that: it has regularly voted to reverse cuts to the payments made to doctors for treating Medicare patients, for example.</p>
<p>The supercommittee is not the only potential for fiscal fireworks hanging over the markets. A stopgap measure funding most government operations expires on November 18th and the two parties are already wrangling over how to extend it. In coming weeks, Congress must also vote on a balanced-budget amendment. The silver lining of Europe’s crisis is that it diverts attention from the divisions that continue to hobble American budget making.</p>
